# Berlin Functional Programming Group

This is a centralized repository for the various projects and activities of the [Berlin Functional Programming Group](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Functional-Programming-Group/). Pull requests are welcome and encouraged from members of the group. Chat with us live in the `#berlin` channel of the [FPChat](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com) Slack community.

## Working groups

The BFPG is divided into a number of smaller working groups. Each working group is focused on a specific topic, activity, or logistical concern. Any member may propose to start a working group at any time. You may want to start a book club, a study group, or just a group for advocating a language or technology.

### Facilitation

The Facilitation working group finds space for and schedules meetings, does outreach to bring in new members, and promotes diversity within the BFPG.

### HackTime

HackTime is what it sounds likeâ€”a time for getting together and hacking. The working group responsible for HackTime solicits proposals for projects to work on, libraries or topics to explore, etc. Anyone may propose something for HackTime, and it's one of the main reasons this group exists, so everyone should!

### Thought Leadership

The Thought Leadership working group will aid members in their professional development by helping them to enhance their skills in public speaking, preparing presentations, pitching FP to their colleagues, writing effectively for both technical and general audiences, and overall communication.

### [Papers We Love](https://github.com/sjsyrek/berlin-functional-programming-group/tree/master/papers)

The Papers We Love working group is a reading group for people who want to read and discuss academic papers. The format for each meeting will be whatever the group decides.

### [Book Club](https://github.com/sjsyrek/berlin-functional-programming-group/tree/master/book-club)

The Book Club working group decides which Computer Science texts to read collectively, when and where to meet to discuss them, and what sorts of coding projects to present in tandem with chapter readings.

### Study Groups

Study groups are temporary groups for people to learn programming languages (or any other topic) following a specified curriculum. The following study groups have been proposed: 

- [Haskell study group](https://github.com/sjsyrek/berlin-functional-programming-group/tree/master/haskell-study-group)
- [Clojure study group](https://github.com/sjsyrek/berlin-functional-programming-group/tree/master/clojure-study-group)
